# Development concepts

## [[CSS modules]]

- CSS modules are modular and reusable CSS styles.
- Allows development with styles that do not conflict with external style definitions.

## [[Configuration management]]

- PWA Studio provides tools to help manage configurations across different environments, such as local development, staging, and production

## [[GraphQL]]

- A specification for a data query language client side and a service layer on the server side.
- Used to request and push data in a progressive web application

## [[Routing ]]

- Routing is the process of mapping a URL to specific page resources
- Learn what tools PWA Studio provides to support both server-side and client-side routing

## [[State management]]

- State management describes the way the application handles changing state data as a result of user interactions

## [[Talons]]

- Peregrine Talongs are the logic component counterparts for Venia UI components.
- Each Talon in Peregrine is designed to provide data or perform side effects for a specific Venia UI component

# Application features

## [[Application shell]]

- An application shell provides the basic user interface structure for a progressive web application

## [[Client-side caching]]

- Client-side caching is the process of storing data into a local cache after a network fetch

## [[Content rendering]]

- Content rendering explains how a browser gets the final HTML content for a requested page

## [[Extensibility]]

- Learn about PWA Studio's extensibility framework and how you can extend the base Venia storefront application

## [[Internationalization]]

- Internationalization or i18n is a feature that lets you localize content for a culture, region or language

# Common terms

## Service worker

- A service worker is a script that runs in the background.
- Progressive web applications use service workers for caching and resource retrieval

## Component data binding

- Component data binding refer to the way data flows between the source and a UI component 
- Progressive web applications use data binding patterns to connect dynamic data with the user interface

## Client state, reducers, and actions

- Client state, reducers and actions are [[Redux]] concepts used to manage and handle the state of a web application

## Loading and offline states

- Loading and offline are both states that must bee handled by progressive web application

## Container extensibility

- Writing extensible containers allow others to re-use and alter your container without modifying the source

## Performance patterns

- Performance is an important feature for a progressive web app
- There are many strategies and patterns available to help boost the performance of a PWA

## Root components and routing

- The root component of an application is the DOM node under which all other nodes are managed by React
- Routing is the ability to map a URL pattern to the appropriate handler.

## Critical path

- The critical path for rendering refers to the steps the browser takes to process the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files to display a website
- Optimizing the critical path is important to get the best performance out of a progressive web application
